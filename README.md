# PersonInheritance
## Project Overview
### Purpose
This project uses inheritance to keep track of people, university people, and students.
### Features
- Inheritance
- Data Encapsulation
- Arrays
- Classes
- Methods
- Sorting Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Programming
### Prerequisites
- Java
  - Classes: Object
  - Skills: methods, arrays, classes, inheritance, data encapsulation, sorting algorithms, object-oriented programming
- Unix Commands
## Project Setup
### Running the Code
Download the files from the GitHub repository. Open the files in an IDE. In the IDE terminal, navigate to the folder where the files are held using the Unix command "cd". Once in the correct folder, compile all of the files using the command "javac fileName". Then, to run the code and display the menu in the terminal, use the command "java fileName" with the PersonInheritance.java file. Be sure that all of the files are in the same folder, or the code will create an error.
